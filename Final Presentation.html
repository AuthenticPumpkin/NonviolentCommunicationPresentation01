Now we are going to do RAPID Hmmmppphh intros
Say your name (ONLY your name, not my name is..), make an action or a weird face expression alongwith either a YES or a NO depending on whether or not you have heard of NVC before, the way you say yes/no should match the action, and then everybody repeats the name and sound. You choose the next person to go.
For e.g. Vikraant, Yhhesssss! (hulk style)
or Vikraant, Noooo :( (scary face style)
 your challenge as a group is to finish this in 2 minutes starting now, covering everyone and GO<br><br>
                        
                        Giraffes - the animals with the largest heart are an embodiment of the intention behind NVC<br>The intention is to create a quality of connection that is necessary to meet everyone's needs compassionately<br><br>
Nonviolent Communication holds that most conflicts between individuals or groups arise from miscommunication about their human needs, due to coercive or manipulative language that aims to induce fear, guilt, shame, etc. .</p>

                <p>Now there are two things you can do<br>
                Option A: You assert your right and watch netflix because your mom's always 
                doing conferences and she has no right to keep you from meeting your needs.<br>

                Option B: You say, "hey mom, can I watch netflix on your work iPad instead so that we can both fulfill our needs?"<br>

                (STOP SCREEN SHARING go to gallery view)<br>

                Now, I invite you to switch to gallery view...
                and turn off your video if YOU would choose option 1,turn on your video if you would choose option 2<br>

                So, there you go, the point is very simple - NVC is based on the assumption that We would prefer to meet needs in ways that don’t harm others if we                   recognize a path of action that will also meet our own needs.</p>

                <p>The amazing thing about humans is that the most base need for everyone is simply a need to contribute to life, to contribute to others, to give,                     to feel nice about oneself and fulfilled and satisfied because "hey I did something nice :)" Pinch your nose if you resonate with that.<br>

                    NVC begins by assuming that we are all compassionate by nature and that violent strategies—whether verbal or physical—are learned behaviors                           taught and supported by the prevailing culture created to dominate over the underprivileged.</p>

                type it out in no more than a small sentence or even a word and hit send<br>

            <div class="notes">
                <p> Great! Now, take a moment and think about how else you could meet that exact need? Type it out, send it over<br>

                (Read them out - exactly! You could read a book - could read NVC, you could help your dad in the kitchen to feel good about yourself etc.)<br>

                SO - Where we differ from each other is in our strategies to connect/meet needs. Conflicts occur at the level of strategies, not needs. <br>

                For e.g. A strategy to meet your need of connection could be to want to talk your boyfriend/bestfriend right now, but he/she/they are tired or don't                    like being on the phone for long periods of time (jazz hands if you can relate to either person in that scenario)<br>

                but hey, maybe they would agree to watch the same episode of netflix with you from afar, that's connection! <br>
                maybe they would like to do Yoga with you on the phone where you each choose a pose, that's a connection!<br>
                And so instead of blaming your friend - "you don't love me like I love you! You never want to talk to me!", you can choose to be the Giraffe in the                     situation and find another strategy of meeting your needs.<br><br>
                        (1 substep: Where we differ from each other is in our strategies to meet needs.<br>Conflicts occur at the level of strategies, not needs)<br>
                    (SWITCH OFF SCREEN SHARING, GALLERY VIEW, CAMERAS ON)<br>
                How would you feel when your needs are recognized and attended to?<br>
                Show me an expression of how would you feel?<br>
                we feel happy, satisfied, excited, etc.<br>

                How would you feel when your needs are NOT recognized or attended to?<br>
                When our needs are not recognized and attended to, we feel sad, scared, angry, etc<br>

                Feelings are a result of either our needs being met or our needs not being met. Simple. You feel angry, some need is not being met, you feel                            satisfied, some need is being met.<br>

Is that an observation or an evaluation? Type it into the chat.<br>

Observation: The paint on that wall is peeling off.<br>
Evaluation: That wall needs a fresh coat of paint.<br>

So in NVC practice:<br>
A violent evaluation is: "Boy, that Amber is a really lazy person! She won't get the project in on time"<br>
Separated observation: Amber turned in her last 3 projects late.</p>

Firstly, lets just blacklist the words ALWAYS and NEVER, ironically they are almost ALWAYS followed by evaluations.<br>

Do you see the negative impact of an evaluation? What are you doing there?<br>
(You are terming a person as having a set particular quality - if I tell you "You are really aggresive" You would probably feel bad and judged and not very kindly towards me. But, If I present concrete observations "Hey, bud, I thought you were aggrseive with your kid brother back there, do you want to talk?" - while taking responsibility for my thoughts then I am not naming/judging you anymore.)</p>

            <p>2. Taking <em>responsibility</em> for our <em>feelings</em><br>+<br>Differentiating between feelings and thoughts.</p>
            <div class="notes">
                    <p>You might know a version of this rhyme that children in my neighbourhood used to sing when I was 5, "Sticks and stones can break my bones, but names can never hurt me"<br>Even at age 5 we had the awareness that we have a choice as to how we react to things and other peoples names could only hurt us depending on how we took it<br>
                            Responsibility = Response + able, we can only be responsible for that which we are able to control, we can't control how people interpret our behaviour, therefore we are not responsible for the feelings that follow their interpretaions, BUT, a big BUT we can control and are hence responsible for our behaviour itself and our intentions, we can control whether our behaviour is harming somebody or not.<br><br>Likewise, Other people are responsible for their behaviour, for things they say and do, and we are responsible for how we take it!<br><br>
                            I got slapped twice last week... The first time was when I was stopping a man from being violent with his wife, I came in between them and he slapped me. I could have strangled him, I felt so enraged.<br>
The second time was when I was telling the lady in question why she should love herself as much as she loves for her children and if one of her children wanted to stay with the dad, then he could. She slapped me, "how dare you say something like that!!" I felt nothing but empathy and compassion for her.<br>
I chose to feel anger. I chose to feel compassion. Their action towards me didn't make me feel anything, I did.<br><br>
                    So in NVC we follow any expression of feelings with BECAUSE I. I am feeling hurt because I, never you make me feel, or I feel angry because you. Always I feel because I. Our feelings are a result of how we take things.</p>

Thoughts, evaluations, judgements and criticisms usually follow when you follow "I feel" with "that, he/she/they/you, like, it etc."

While taking responsibility for your feelings, you say "I feel _ because I __am needing_ or was expecting" and not "I feel _ because you _did this_"</p>

                        Your bed isn't made, your ipad is lying on your pillow with oily fingerprints on it, the bedroom floor is strewn with clothes - clean and dirty, your closet is all over the place.<br>

Your mum sees your room and goes into a tantrum, you are being shouted at, blamed, called lazy-good-for-nothing, grounded etc.<br>

What are the base human needs of your Mum that are not being met?<br>

                <p>4. Making or hearing <em>concrete requests</em> that are <em>gifts</em> to others.</p>
            <div class="notes">
                <p>When people hear our requests and see it as an opportunity to contribute to our wellbeing, to give to us, it gives them this opportunity to do what we human beings love more than anything else - to serve life, to contribute and feel good about themselves!<br>
                        But if the same request is heard as a demand, it threatens the person's AUTONOMY, it comes from a feeling of enslavement! And if they say yes, when they don't want to, they are doing something for you not out of compassion, or a desire to enrich your life, but out of fear that they will be punished, rejected, guilted, shamed etc.
                        After we have expressed our observations, feelings, needs to the other person, we follow it up with what we would like for them to do to contribute to our wellbeing.
                        This is done by saying what we DO want, rather than what we don't want (don't = heard as criticism and confusion as to what they actually should do)
                        +
                        concrete action language, 
                        an IMPORTANT differencebecause the energy they are doing it with is not of receiving your request as a gift, reduces their chances of responding compassionately to you in the future.

<p>Step 1: Positive action language - saying what we DO want, rather than what we don't want (don't = heard as criticism and confusion as to what they actually should do)<br>
        Step 2 : Concrete action language = We want to avoid vague, abstract or ambiguos phrasing.<br>
        In this cartoon, the man is drowning, he shouts out to his dog on the shore, "lassie get help", in the next frame we see lassie on the psychiatrists couch. We all know how help means different things to different people.<br>
                Step3: Follow through - there should be room to say no - in the energy that you say it with, if someone can't say no, it doesn't help either of you, it generates ill-will, reduces compassion</p>
